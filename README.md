Predicting Student Grades using Feed Forward Neural Network 

The code uses a feed forward neural network to predict student final grades using various student attributes (such as parents' jobs, access to internet, attendance, etc.). The data used was on Math Students from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/math-students?resource=download), with 395 samples.

A limitation of this project is that the data size is very small, and thus is not able to adequately train the machine for a high degree of accuracy. A larger dataset with the same attributes may result in higher accuracy.
